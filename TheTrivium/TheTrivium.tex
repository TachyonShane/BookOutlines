        \end{outline}
      \item Characteristics of Substantives

      \begin{outline}
        \item Verbs
          \begin{outline}
            \item Express an attribute with a sense of time; make an assertion
            \item \textit{Transitive} verbs flow from subject to object; \textit{intransitive} verbs stay with the agent

            \item \textit{Mood} - expresses relation between subject and predicate

            \item \textit{Infinitives} - standard dictionary form of a verb (e.g., ``to take")
            \item \textit{Gerunds} -  end in ``-ing" and function as nouns
            \item \textit{Participles} - end in ``-ed" or ``-ing" and function as adjectives
          \end{outline}
        \item Adjectives - Unlike verbs or verbals, adjectives express attributes with no notion of time
        \item Adverbs - \textit{Secondary} attributives in that they modify primary attributives (e.g., verbs and adjectives)
        \end{outline}   
        \newpage
    \item {\bf Definitives} - single out an individual (``this") or group (``those")
    \item {\bf Connectives} - connect words and sentences
      \begin{outline}
        \item \textit{Prepositions} - connect words and show their relation (e.g., ``in" or ``behind")

    \item {\bf The Pure Copula} - links a subject with a predicate (e.g., ``The book {\bf is} on the table.")
  \end{outline}
  \item {\bf Terms and Their Grammatical Equivalents}
    \begin{outline}
      \item Empirical vs. General Terms
      \begin{outline}
      \item \textit{Empirical} terms designate a specific individual or group (e.g., ``This cat is purring")
      \item \textit{General} terms signify something universal or essentials (e.g., ``Cats purr")
      \end{outline}
      \item Positive vs. negative terms (e.g., ``awake" vs. ``unawake," ``blue" vs. ``non-blue")
      \item Concrete vs. abstract terms (e.g., ``human" vs. ``humanness")
      \item Absolute vs. relative terms
        \begin{outline}
          \item \textit{Absolute} terms can be understood on their own (``man", ``woman")

          \end{outline}
        \item Collective vs. distributive terms
          \begin{outline}
            \item \textit{Collective} terms apply to a group as a single entity (``The platoon marched its way north.")
            \item \textit{Distributive} terms apply to a group's individual members (``The platoon marched their way north.")
            \end{outline}
            \item Extension and intension
            \begin{outline}
              \item \textit{Extension} refers to the complete set of objects to which a term applies (prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11...)
              \item \textit{Intension} refers to the essential meaning (prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 whose factors are only 1 and themselves)
              \end{outline}
              \item Definitions
              \begin{outline}
                \item \textit{Logical} definitions describe a species in terms of its proximate genus and specific differentia (man is a rational animal)
                \item \textit{Distinctive} definitions describe a species in terms of its genus and some non-essential property (man is an animal capable of written language).
                \item \textit{Causal} definitions describe an entity in terms of its causes (AIDS is a syndrome caused by advanced HIV infection)
                \item \textit{Descriptive} definitions list the traits by which a species can be identified (a domestic cat is a small, furry, quadripedal mammal with whiskers, a tail, and a regal demeanor)
                \item \textit{Definition by example} uses a set of examples that can be used to arrive at an abstraction (a cactus is a plant like a saguaro, cholla, or prickly pear)
                \end{outline}
    \end{outline}
  \item {\bf Propositions and Their Grammatical Expression}
  \item {\bf Relations of Simple Propositions}
